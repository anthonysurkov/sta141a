For an informed project proposal... (due Jan 24th)
Need to
(a) Read the Nature paper in full + understand it
(b) Read his code and directions in full + understand it
(c) Understand the datasets holistically; what data it has, where it is, how it was made, etc.
(d) Formulate a project proposal according to his requirements. Make it insightful and slightly
    ambitious; I want to work with him following this

Let's do (a) this weekend (due Jan 12th)
(b) by Wednesday or so (due Jan 15th)
(c) by Friday or so (due Jan 17th)
(d) by next Friday (due Jan 24th)

This allows a fair bit of buffer while encouraging proactivity.
